# User Persona
Bob: As a struggling farmer who just took over his family's business, I want to decide whether to grow strawberries or apples. I am turning to a fortune telling app to tell me which fruit will cause my business to grow more. 

## Features
1. One feature that I am looking for is a directory that will show me all possibilities that I could get, and what they mean.
2. Another feature that I want in the app is some interactivity, because I like to engage in fun mini-games in apps.
3. The last feature I want implemented is different themes that I can choose from, since I might get bored of the same theme.
