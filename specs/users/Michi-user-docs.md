# Story/Personas
John is a 35-year-old software engineer who is constantly under pressure at work. He is looking for ways to manage his stress and improve his overall well-being. He has heard about the benefits of fortune-telling and wants to try it out to see if it can help him find some clarity.

As John, I want to use the app to receive daily or weekly readings that provide me with insights into my personal and professional life so that I can make better decisions and feel more in control.

1. I'm thinking that the user should put in their question, and depending on the card they get, the answer that they recieve will be different. We could use generative ai to make these answers.
2. I'm thinking that when a card is picked, there would be a dramatic effect, like the card spinning at fast speeds or perhaps coming from a night sky or something like that.
