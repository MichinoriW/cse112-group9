  - .input-text-div  
    This centers the question text and input text box in the middle of the screen by making it a block element and centering all text and items. 

  - @font-face  
    Imports the font "AlmendraSC-Regular" to use in the output text box. This is a more mystical font that matches the theme better than the standard serif font.  
  
  - .answer  
    Styles the output text located in the middle of the 8-ball to match the theme of the ball and the overall page (orange, dark, mystical). Centers it in the middle of the 8-ball and uses a different font that matches the theme (AlmendraSC-Regular).
