# Magic 8-Ball Project

## Intro:


## How to Use:


## Code Docs:
- index.html  
  This contains all of the HTML and structure of the 8-Ball webpage
  
- style.css  
  This contains all of the styling and visual design of the 8-ball page

  - .ballwrapper  
    This is styling for the element containing the ball itself. It is used for placing
    the 8-ball on the screen relative to the size of the user window

  - #ball  
    This is the styling for the 8-ball itself. The 8-ball was drawn purely by CSS and
    box shadows were used to set concentric rings around the center of the 8 ball. 

  - .input-text-div  
    This centers the question text and input text box in the middle of the screen by making it a block element and centering all text and items. 

  - @font-face  
    Imports the font "AlmendraSC-Regular" to use in the output text box. This is a more mystical font that matches the theme better than the standard serif font.  
  
  - .answer  
    Styles the output text located in the middle of the 8-ball to match the theme of the ball and the overall page (orange, dark, mystical). Centers it in the middle of the 8-ball and uses a different font that matches the theme (AlmendraSC-Regular).
    
  - .instructions  
    Styles the instructions to the user for how to obtain their answer from the 8-ball. Consists of
    just positioning and font changes
  
  - @keyframes move-clouds1
    Animation that moves an object from the left edge of the screen to the right edge, starting and ending offscreen. Meant to be used on an element of the "cloud" class.

  - @keyframes move-clouds2
    Animation that moves an object from the right edge of the screen to the left edge, starting and ending offscreen. Meant to be used on an element of the "cloud" class.

  - .cloud
    A class for a cloud object that the 'move-clouds1' or 'move-clouds2' animation should be used on. Has an opacity value of 0.4 to simulate the translucent nature of real clouds. It's position is set to absolute, and it has a z-index of -1 so it travels behind other elements and doesn't interfere with their function. The cloud class should be used on a img element with an image of a cloud, and the position from the top should be specified in inline CSS for each element of class cloud. The inline CSS should also have 'move-clouds1 Xs linear infinite' or 'move-clouds2 Xs linear infinite' in it, where X is a positive integer.
    
- script.js
  
  This contains all of the scripting and functions necessary for the functionality of the 8-Ball
    
  - responses[] 
    This contains an array of canned responses for the 8-ball. There are 20 total and they
    are the standard Magic 8-Ball answers 
    
  - predict()
    This function is responsible for displaying the 8-ball prediction in the 8-ball. We generate
    a random unmber in the range of 1 to 20 and use that as an index to determine which answer to 
    reveal to the user from the responses array
  
  - typeResponse()
    The function takes in as input the string to animate the typing out the given string, which in 
    the context of the project is the prediction result. The function uses an interval to update the 
    content in the html page that holds the response (in this case the element with id="response") 
    one character of the input string at a time until the end of the string.

  - ball/document EventListeners
    Function to print 8-Ball answer one character at a time as if it is being typed. We separate
    the characters and then print them individually one after the other with a predetermined rate

  - ball.addEventListener('mousedown')
    On event user clicks on the eight ball, set up for shaking
    Do not allow shaking while the 8-ball is speaking.

  - document.addEventListener('mousemove')
    On event user moves mouse anywhere on webpage, move 8-ball
    too. This simulates shaking the 8-ball. Keep track of if
    the 8-ball has been shaken hard enough.

  - document.addEventListener('mouseup')
    On event user lets go of mouse, stop shaking the 8-ball.
    Return 8-ball to original place, and output response. Reset
    variables for next shaking.

  - Variables
    *synth* - Handler for text to speech
    *response* - Element for <p> used to output 8-ball response
    *ball* - Element for <div> that is the 8-ball
    *ballDisplayOffset[]* - array of 2 floats with original offset/position of 8-ball
    *ballOffset[]* - array of 2 floats with updated position of 8-ball
    *isMoving* - boolean indicating whether 8-ball has been shaken hard enough
    *isDown* - boolean indicating whether 8-ball is being pressed
