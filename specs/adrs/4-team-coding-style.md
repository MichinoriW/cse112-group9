# Team Coding Style

## Context and Problem Statement

## Considered Options

2. Callback functions vs in-line functions (within event listeners for example)

## Decision Outcome

1. Camelcase 
2. Callback functions

## Rationale
1. Most of the team was most comfortable with camelcase as opposed to the other options. 
2. Most of the team thought callback functions were easier to read and easier to work with.
