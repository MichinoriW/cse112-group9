# Team Coding Style

## Context and Problem Statement

It is important for all members of the team to make files with similar naming schema so that files can be easily identified and organized. 

## Considered Options

* dashes between words 
* CSS files end with "style.css" vs no specific suffix
* JS files end with "script.js" vs no specific suffix
* HTML files should describe webpage

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen options:**
In the end we decided on using dashes between words, have CSS files end with "style.css", have JS files end with "script.js" and make sure HTML files describe the page they are for. 

## Rationale
Our goal was to make all file names as clear as possible, therefore, we decided on explicitly mentioning style.css and script.js for CSS and JS files respectively. The dashes is simply a convention that most team members are comfortable with.
