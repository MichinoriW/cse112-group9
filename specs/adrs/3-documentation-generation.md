# Documentation Generation Tool

## Context and Problem Statement

It was noted during a meeting that documentation could be automatically generated by some tools. This could speed up the process of compiling everyone's documentation and putting it together in one place. 

## Considered Options

* JSDocs
* Docusaurus
* Wiki.js

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** JSDocs

## Rationale
This tool seems like the safest bet as it has been regularly used for over a decade at this point. Moreover, it is not so feature-full (such as Wiki.js) such that it might be overkill for our project. 

## Other Information
JSDocs will be the tool that is used to generate documentation. All coders will need to follow a certain commenting style to accomodate this. Moreover, we will need to npm install jsdoc.
