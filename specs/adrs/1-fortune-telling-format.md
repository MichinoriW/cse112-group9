# ADR 1: Card Based Fortune Telling as Fortune Telling Format

## Context and Problem Statement

There are many ways to produce a fortune telling app. Which system of fortune telling will work best for our team to accomplish the features we want and have an MVP completed by Week 8?

## Considered Options

* Image recognition using AI
* Cards reading similar to tarot cards
* Picking a fortune from a box

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** Card based fortune telling

## Rationale
Card based fortune telling allows us to focus more on making the "ceremony" aspect of our app more elaborate. It also allowed the most flexibility to incoporate more elements from everyone's research. Image recognition, while cool, seemed to ambitious for the scope of this class and time.
