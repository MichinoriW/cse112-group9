[Current Actions](#currently-implemented) | [Future Actions](#future-additions)

## Currently Implemented

### JS Hint
- Used to check code quality
- Notes:
  - In the [yml](../../.github/workflows/ci-cd-piepline.yml), there is a config file that is written (lines 13-17) that specify two options:
    - `esversion = 6`: this says that our JS code is written to follow [ECMAScript 6]()
