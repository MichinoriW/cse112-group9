## Tasks Breakdown
___
This is a more detailed section on what actually has to get done per page for the MVP.

### Design
- How will the cards look keeping in mind our design decisions from [last meeting](./050523-brainstorm_fortune_telling_3.md)?
- Where will we design the cards (Canva, Photoshop, etc)?
- How will the background for each page look?
  - For now, a backdrop that is consistent with the design chosen from last meeting will suffice.

### Landing Page
- How will the page look?
- Coordinate with the design team to choose a font
- What is the story of our fortune telling?
  - Doesn't have to be long, just something to set the vibe
  - Will this story describe how our app functions?

### Menu Page
- How will the page look?
- Coordinate with design team on overall look
- Will the buttons for each category look different?
  - Just a thought I had - what if when you hover over the button some kind of animation plays (definitely a 2.0 feature but just thought I'd list it)
- Name/Logo for our app?

### "Fortune Bank" Page
- How will the page look?
- How are we going to use local storage to accomplish this?
- Can they click the saved reading to get more information?
  - What info will be shown in each entry?

### Fortune Generation Page
- How will the page look?
  - How will the cards be arranged
  - How will the page look when a card is selected
- Will how the page look change depending on what category the user chose?
- How will the fortune be generated?
  - Will we RNG generate a "mood"?
  - What will the responses be
    - We must come up with these depending on the mood and category
      - 3 categories --> 6 moods --> 3 responses per mood?

## Immediate Actions
___
- Start coding!!
- Look at GitHub for issues and assign yourself accordingly
- Communicate and provide more detailed standup messages.
  - These are crucial for Nakul and Brandon to judge the overall direction of the project and divert work if necessary.
  - We are a team and we are here to support one another! We must adopt a bend but don't break mentality!
