Hello! Iâ€™m a second-year CE student who is interesting in learning more about the software engineering process. Additionally, I am curious how AI will be a part of this class as it was hinted at in the syllabus and by the professor during lecture.

I am currently a third-year at UC San Diego studying Math-Computer Science. Some of my hobbies include listening to music, playing video games with friends, and
going on late night drives to release stress. My goals for this course include learning what it means to work with others effectively as a software engineer.
